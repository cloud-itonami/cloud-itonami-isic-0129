(ns perennial.sim
  "Simulation driver for testing the perennial-crop cultivation
  operations actor end-to-end.

  For CLI: clojure -M:dev:run

  Example flow:
    1. Start with empty store
    2. Register a cultivation lot in :intake phase
    3. Propose a cultivation lot -> :record transition with safety
       parameters (applicator license / calibration / PHI / REI / wind /
       buffer zone)
    4. Governor validates parameters against facts
    5. If valid, audit fact is committed
    6. CLI prints audit trail")
